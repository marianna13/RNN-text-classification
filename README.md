# Text Classification with Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
I've used data containing tweets about quality of service of American airlines. The deep neural networks uses LSTM cell to predict sentiment of the given tweet (e.g. positive, neutral aor negative). With Tensorflow/Keras I have achieved accuracy ~80% which is not bad considering small size of the dataset.
